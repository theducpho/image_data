FUNDAMENTALS OF DIGITAL MARKETING


MODULE 4/26: Plan your online business strategy

1. The benefits of an online strategy

+ The first step is to clearly define your goals.

+ Next up is articulating what your business stands for.
This can be represented by a simple sentence, generally referred to as a mission statement.
For example, this might be “to inspire healthier communities” or “to provide fun spaces for everyday fitness".

+ You also need to identify your Unique Selling Point (or USP) -
this is what makes you stand out from your competition online. 


2. Taking a business online

+ What are the key differences between a customer in a physical shop and a customer online?

-  In the offline world your journey might go a bit like this:
You visit the local shopping centre, going from shop to shop.
Ultimately, you make a decision based on price, quality, returns policy, friendliness of staff,
and stock availability.

- When it comes to online purchasing, you’re likely to engage in four distinct stages
throughout your online shopping journey.
Theses principles are described in the “See, Think, Do, Care”.

+ You can segment customers in many ways, from basic demographics like age and gender,
to specific interests.

+ When it comes to taking a business online, think about the customers
and put yourself in their shoes: which channels do they use most?
How do you engage differently with them online and offline?

3. Understanding customer behaviour

+ Customers are the key to success, which is why understanding and nurturing them is so important.
In this lesson we’ll look at the importance of customer touchpoints.

+ Touchpoints are used a lot in offline business, particularly in retail.
They can be receipts, bags, signage, customer service counters, and many other points along the way.
When a customer encounters a touchpoint multiple times, such as online ads,
this provides consistent value and creates ongoing positive associations with a brand.

+ To wrap up, here are some quick reminders to help you work on your own touchpoints:
- think about the journey you take as a customer when you buy something,
and apply this information to your business scenario.
- if you can, talk to customers to get real-world info on the touchpoints they encounter
- analyse touchpoint performance and optimise your message if required,
so that the customer’s needs always come first.

4. How to stand out from the competition

+ A Unique Selling Point is a clear statement that describes the benefits you offer,
how you might solve your customer’s needs, and what distinguishes you from the competition.
4 key questions to ask yourself when defining your USP are:
- who is my target audience?
- who are my competitors?
- what problems does my target audience have?, and
- how can I solve them?

+ Your USP should be displayed on your website, social media, and other marketing materials.
A good USP won't appeal to everyone, but that’s ok.
Build a USP that is tailored and speaks directly to your target audience.

+ SWOT analysis:
- what is it we’re good at? These are your strengths
- what can we do better? These are your weaknesses
- how can we grow, change and improve ? These are your opportunities
- what is happening or could happen, both internally and externally,
that might affect us negatively ? Those are the threats.

+ While constructing your USP, it’s a good idea to check what the competition is up to.
Search and see what the competition is up to. Use tool Google Alerts.

5. Using goals to improve business performance

+ Key Performance Indicators, or KPIs, are quantifiable measurements used to focus
attention on the metrics most important to meet business goals.
There are many ways to construct KPIs, but they should all be
measurable, practical, achievable, and provide direction.

+ Try creating your own KPIs and see if you can answer the following:
a. Is this KPI specific enough ?
b. Can it be measured ?
c. Can employees attain this ?
d. How relevant is it to the wider business objective ?
e. And lastly, when is it due to be delivered or carried out ?

MODULE 5/26 Get started with search

1. Search engine basics

+ One of the earliest search engines was a program called Archie, which debuted in 1990 and
allowed people to access and search file names—basically the names of the web pages.

2. How search engines work

+ The basics on how search engines find web pages, what they do with the pages they find,
and how they decide what results to show.

+ They all perform three tasks:
- First, they examine content they learn about andhave permission to see (that’s called crawling).
- Second, they categorise each piece of content (that’s called indexing).
- And third, they decide which content is most useful to searchers (that’s called ranking).

+ Search engines may find multiple copies of the exact same piece of content,
located on different websites. So you’re likely better off writing your own description.

3. How search engines see the web

+ In simple terms, when you ask a search engine to find something,
it looks through a huge list of previously indexed pages, called “the index,” and
pulls out relevant results based on what you’re looking for.

+ But when a search engine looks at the same page, in addition to seeing what you see on your screen,
it also sees the code behind it, called HTML.
- title tag
- name of image
- use tool CMS

4. Organic search explained

+ Organic results typically appear in the st match for the search query, or words, that were typed,
in centre of the page, and are the results the search engine decides are the be.

+ Making improvements to your website to help it appear in the organic results is
called search engine optimisation, or SEO.
Good SEO involves helping a search engine find and understand your site.

+ What do search engines like? Good, relevant content.
All you have to do is make sure that your content is relevant to the people searching,
so they’ll click and stay for a visit.

5. Paid search explained

+ We’ll cover how advertising on search engines works—that’s called SEM, or search engine marketing.

+ Every time someone searches advertisers compete for the opportunity to display ads.
It happens in milliseconds and the searcher won’t see the details, only the winners: the ads that appear on the page.
So, how do search engines decide who wins? The primary components are the bid and the quality.

6. Google search console

+ Google Search Console? Well, it's a service that gives you feedback about how your website is doing
in Google search results. It has two primary functions. It monitors your performance in Google Search results.
And it also shows you how Google “sees” your site.

+ One way is through its “Search Analytics” reports.
This can help you answer a few important questions like which searches bring people to your site.
Or tell you when searchers click on your links. They can even let you know which other sites link to yours.

+ Another thing to look for is the number of clicks.
You’ll want to know how often your site appears but gets no clicks—
that’s a sign your content doesn’t match what people are looking for.

+ The “Links to your site” report shows websites that link to your site. Think of these as “referrals.”

+ Mobile Usability Report

+ There are two more really handy features within Search Console to know about:
“Crawl” reports, and “Google Index” reports.
- “Crawl” reports let you monitor whether Google can visit your web pages.
This is important because if Google can’t access your web pages,
your content can’t be included in Google’s search results.

- The “Google Index” reports show what information Google recorded about your site and
tells you if your pages are accessible. It’s easy to get started with Search Console.
