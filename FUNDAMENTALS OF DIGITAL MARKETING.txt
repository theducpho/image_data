FUNDAMENTALS OF DIGITAL MARKETING


MODULE 4/26: Plan your online business strategy

1. The benefits of an online strategy

+ The first step is to clearly define your goals.

+ Next up is articulating what your business stands for.
This can be represented by a simple sentence, generally referred to as a mission statement.
For example, this might be “to inspire healthier communities” or “to provide fun spaces for everyday fitness".

+ You also need to identify your Unique Selling Point (or USP) -
this is what makes you stand out from your competition online. 


2. Taking a business online

+ What are the key differences between a customer in a physical shop and a customer online?

-  In the offline world your journey might go a bit like this:
You visit the local shopping centre, going from shop to shop.
Ultimately, you make a decision based on price, quality, returns policy, friendliness of staff,
and stock availability.

- When it comes to online purchasing, you’re likely to engage in four distinct stages
throughout your online shopping journey.
Theses principles are described in the “See, Think, Do, Care”.

+ You can segment customers in many ways, from basic demographics like age and gender,
to specific interests.

+ When it comes to taking a business online, think about the customers
and put yourself in their shoes: which channels do they use most?
How do you engage differently with them online and offline?

3. Understanding customer behaviour

+ Customers are the key to success, which is why understanding and nurturing them is so important.
In this lesson we’ll look at the importance of customer touchpoints.

+ Touchpoints are used a lot in offline business, particularly in retail.
They can be receipts, bags, signage, customer service counters, and many other points along the way.
When a customer encounters a touchpoint multiple times, such as online ads,
this provides consistent value and creates ongoing positive associations with a brand.

+ To wrap up, here are some quick reminders to help you work on your own touchpoints:
- think about the journey you take as a customer when you buy something,
and apply this information to your business scenario.
- if you can, talk to customers to get real-world info on the touchpoints they encounter
- analyse touchpoint performance and optimise your message if required,
so that the customer’s needs always come first.

4. How to stand out from the competition

+ A Unique Selling Point is a clear statement that describes the benefits you offer,
how you might solve your customer’s needs, and what distinguishes you from the competition.
4 key questions to ask yourself when defining your USP are:
- who is my target audience?
- who are my competitors?
- what problems does my target audience have?, and
- how can I solve them?

+ Your USP should be displayed on your website, social media, and other marketing materials.
A good USP won't appeal to everyone, but that’s ok.
Build a USP that is tailored and speaks directly to your target audience.

+ SWOT analysis:
- what is it we’re good at? These are your strengths
- what can we do better? These are your weaknesses
- how can we grow, change and improve ? These are your opportunities
- what is happening or could happen, both internally and externally,
that might affect us negatively ? Those are the threats.

+ While constructing your USP, it’s a good idea to check what the competition is up to.
Search and see what the competition is up to. Use tool Google Alerts.

5. Using goals to improve business performance

+ Key Performance Indicators, or KPIs, are quantifiable measurements used to focus
attention on the metrics most important to meet business goals.
There are many ways to construct KPIs, but they should all be
measurable, practical, achievable, and provide direction.

+ Try creating your own KPIs and see if you can answer the following:
a. Is this KPI specific enough ?
b. Can it be measured ?
c. Can employees attain this ?
d. How relevant is it to the wider business objective ?
e. And lastly, when is it due to be delivered or carried out ?
