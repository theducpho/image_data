FUNDAMENTALS OF DIGITAL MARKETING


MODULE 4/26: Plan your online business strategy

1. The benefits of an online strategy

+ The first step is to clearly define your goals.

+ Next up is articulating what your business stands for.
This can be represented by a simple sentence, generally referred to as a mission statement.
For example, this might be “to inspire healthier communities” or “to provide fun spaces for everyday fitness".

+ You also need to identify your Unique Selling Point (or USP) -
this is what makes you stand out from your competition online. 


2. Taking a business online

+ What are the key differences between a customer in a physical shop and a customer online?

-  In the offline world your journey might go a bit like this:
You visit the local shopping centre, going from shop to shop.
Ultimately, you make a decision based on price, quality, returns policy, friendliness of staff,
and stock availability.

- When it comes to online purchasing, you’re likely to engage in four distinct stages
throughout your online shopping journey.
Theses principles are described in the “See, Think, Do, Care”.

+ You can segment customers in many ways, from basic demographics like age and gender,
to specific interests.

+ When it comes to taking a business online, think about the customers
and put yourself in their shoes: which channels do they use most?
How do you engage differently with them online and offline?

3. Understanding customer behaviour

+ Customers are the key to success, which is why understanding and nurturing them is so important.
In this lesson we’ll look at the importance of customer touchpoints.

+ Touchpoints are used a lot in offline business, particularly in retail.
They can be receipts, bags, signage, customer service counters, and many other points along the way.
When a customer encounters a touchpoint multiple times, such as online ads,
this provides consistent value and creates ongoing positive associations with a brand.

+ To wrap up, here are some quick reminders to help you work on your own touchpoints:
- think about the journey you take as a customer when you buy something,
and apply this information to your business scenario.
- if you can, talk to customers to get real-world info on the touchpoints they encounter
- analyse touchpoint performance and optimise your message if required,
so that the customer’s needs always come first.

4. How to stand out from the competition

+ A Unique Selling Point is a clear statement that describes the benefits you offer,
how you might solve your customer’s needs, and what distinguishes you from the competition.
4 key questions to ask yourself when defining your USP are:
- who is my target audience?
- who are my competitors?
- what problems does my target audience have?, and
- how can I solve them?

+ Your USP should be displayed on your website, social media, and other marketing materials.
A good USP won't appeal to everyone, but that’s ok.
Build a USP that is tailored and speaks directly to your target audience.

+ SWOT analysis:
- what is it we’re good at? These are your strengths
- what can we do better? These are your weaknesses
- how can we grow, change and improve ? These are your opportunities
- what is happening or could happen, both internally and externally,
that might affect us negatively ? Those are the threats.

+ While constructing your USP, it’s a good idea to check what the competition is up to.
Search and see what the competition is up to. Use tool Google Alerts.

5. Using goals to improve business performance

+ Key Performance Indicators, or KPIs, are quantifiable measurements used to focus
attention on the metrics most important to meet business goals.
There are many ways to construct KPIs, but they should all be
measurable, practical, achievable, and provide direction.

+ Try creating your own KPIs and see if you can answer the following:
a. Is this KPI specific enough ?
b. Can it be measured ?
c. Can employees attain this ?
d. How relevant is it to the wider business objective ?
e. And lastly, when is it due to be delivered or carried out ?

MODULE 5/26 Get started with search

1. Search engine basics

+ One of the earliest search engines was a program called Archie, which debuted in 1990 and
allowed people to access and search file names—basically the names of the web pages.

2. How search engines work

+ The basics on how search engines find web pages, what they do with the pages they find,
and how they decide what results to show.

+ They all perform three tasks:
- First, they examine content they learn about andhave permission to see (that’s called crawling).
- Second, they categorise each piece of content (that’s called indexing).
- And third, they decide which content is most useful to searchers (that’s called ranking).

+ Search engines may find multiple copies of the exact same piece of content,
located on different websites. So you’re likely better off writing your own description.

3. How search engines see the web

+ In simple terms, when you ask a search engine to find something,
it looks through a huge list of previously indexed pages, called “the index,” and
pulls out relevant results based on what you’re looking for.

+ But when a search engine looks at the same page, in addition to seeing what you see on your screen,
it also sees the code behind it, called HTML.
- title tag
- name of image
- use tool CMS

4. Organic search explained

+ Organic results typically appear in the st match for the search query, or words, that were typed,
in centre of the page, and are the results the search engine decides are the be.

+ Making improvements to your website to help it appear in the organic results is
called search engine optimisation, or SEO.
Good SEO involves helping a search engine find and understand your site.

+ What do search engines like? Good, relevant content.
All you have to do is make sure that your content is relevant to the people searching,
so they’ll click and stay for a visit.

5. Paid search explained

+ We’ll cover how advertising on search engines works—that’s called SEM, or search engine marketing.

+ Every time someone searches advertisers compete for the opportunity to display ads.
It happens in milliseconds and the searcher won’t see the details, only the winners: the ads that appear on the page.
So, how do search engines decide who wins? The primary components are the bid and the quality.

6. Google search console

+ Google Search Console? Well, it's a service that gives you feedback about how your website is doing
in Google search results. It has two primary functions. It monitors your performance in Google Search results.
And it also shows you how Google “sees” your site.

+ One way is through its “Search Analytics” reports.
This can help you answer a few important questions like which searches bring people to your site.
Or tell you when searchers click on your links. They can even let you know which other sites link to yours.

+ Another thing to look for is the number of clicks.
You’ll want to know how often your site appears but gets no clicks—
that’s a sign your content doesn’t match what people are looking for.

+ The “Links to your site” report shows websites that link to your site. Think of these as “referrals.”

+ Mobile Usability Report

+ There are two more really handy features within Search Console to know about:
“Crawl” reports, and “Google Index” reports.
- “Crawl” reports let you monitor whether Google can visit your web pages.
This is important because if Google can’t access your web pages,
your content can’t be included in Google’s search results.

- The “Google Index” reports show what information Google recorded about your site and
tells you if your pages are accessible. It’s easy to get started with Search Console.

Go to www.google.com/webmasters.
Once signed in, add your website and complete the verification to prove you own the website.

MODULE 6/26: Get discovered with search

1. Intro to search engine optimisation (SEO)

+ when search engines understand your content, it will be shown to many more potential customers.

+ Search engines have formulas, or algorithms, that help them order the list of results.
The search engines constantly scour the web for new content and try to make sense of it.

+ Where your website appears in these results is affected by the words
you use on your site (fresh farm produce, for example) as well as other factors—such as
how many websites link to yours.

+ What search engines value most is unique, engaging, relevant content
because their job is to find and show the most useful stuff.

2. The importance of an SEO plan

+ In this step-by-step process to create an SEO plan for your website, you'll learn how to:
- develop
- prioritise
- adjust the plan to best suit your goals

+ Your first step should be keyword research. Next, consider related topics.
You should do this at least once a year as part of your SEO plan.

+ Is no one linking to your site? Perhaps you can invite food bloggers to check out
your farm in the hopes that they’ll mention you in a future blog post.
Make a list of anything you think might improve your SEO performance.

+ Give yourself a deadline for each task so you’re working through your SEO plan steadily throughout the year.
OK, once you’ve set this plan in motion, don’t just forget about it.

+ Review your results regularly and shift focus to the areas that need help.

+ Let’s recap. Start with keyword research to understand what your customers are looking for,
then use that info to assess your successes and failures.
Brainstorm solutions to improve your weak spots, and prioritise them.
And never be afraid to redo your SEO plan based on changes in your world and the world of search engines.

3. The SEO process

+ This video explains the SEO process and the steps you need to take in order to optimise your website, including:
- discovering what words or phrases people use to search for your products or services
- improving the content on your site.

+ The first step is called keyword research: discovering what words or phrases people are looking for
when they are searching for products and services related to your business.

+ The work of SEO is never done, because trends come and go, users can change their behavior,
and search engines evolve over time. Your job is to consider how changes will impact your site and
what you need to do to continue to attract unpaid (organic) traffic.
Here are 4 quick tips on how to stay up-to-date on search.
- 1: Learn how search engines work.
- 2: Keep an eye on changes and monitor how they affect your website.
- 3: Find inspiration from other websites.
- 4: Talk to your customers.

4. How to choose keywords

+ Choosing keywords is the cornerstone of successful search engine optimisation. In this video, we'll discuss:
- why you need to do keyword research
- the difference between short tail and long tail keywords
- what to consider when selecting keywords

+ There are three things you should consider when choosing the keywords for your SEO plan.
- First, frequency, or the number of times a word is searched for.
- Our second consideration: Competition. If you have a large, established website,
you may be able to appear on the search engine results for high-volume, highly competitive keywords
- Finally, and most importantly, the third consideration is relevance.
The keywords you select should closely match what you actually offer.

+ Make sure your chosen keywords match the intent of the people who are searching.
How? One option is to use Google Search Console to see which pages appear in search and get clicks.

+ What you need to consider when selecting keywords: frequency, competition and relevance.

5. Setting realistic SEO goals

+ Setting realistic goals for organic traffic and assessing them with measurements
that matter will help you strengthen your SEO strategy. In this video, you'll learn:
- how to define success
- how to select measurements that matter
- what tools can help

+ One way to tackle SEO is to set clear goals, then measure your progress each step of the way.
When you set SEO goals, you can measure, track and report on the results.
You’ll know which efforts are succeeding—and which aren’t. And then you can adjust things to make it work better.

+ You’ve just identified three business goals:
- Conversions: Turning website visitors into paying customers.
- Engagement: Persuading people to interact with the content on your site.
- Acquisition: Getting new customers.

+ The lesson? Don’t waste effort on keywords that aren’t relevant to what you do.

+ You can measure conversions by tracking the number of visitors who come to your website and buy fruits and
vegetables; or tracking a smaller action that can lead to a sale, like signing up for your email newsletter.
+ You can measure acquisition and reach by tracking the number of times your business appears in
search results—your “impressions”—and how often people click through to visit your site.
+ And, you can measure engagement by tracking what content your visitors read and interact with,
such as leaving comments, or how many visitors become your fans on social media networks.
+ So how do you track all these things? Analytics tools and webmaster tools provided by search engines
can give you this information—often for free.


MODULE 7/26: Make search work for you

1. Making your web pages search friendly

+ Get started in search engine optimisation by improving the pages on your website.
This video explains the elements that you can tweak to make your website easier for search engines to understand.
We'll cover:
- title and description meta tags
- heading elements
- page copy

+ The title and meta description are important because they both are used by the search engine
to generate the actual search result for the specific page.
The title is used to generate the first line shown; the meta description is used to
generate the few short sentences that follow. A good meta description is usually two short sentences.
A title should be short and sweet; a description should match what the page is about.

+ What you’ve done to optimise the farm’s web pages. You’ve looked at each of the major elements used by
search engines and, in each instance, told them, “This page is about fresh fruits and vegetables.”

2. How other websites can work for you

+ You can improve your search visibility across the web by thinking about off-site optimisation; that is,
using what happens on other websites to promote yours. This video will show you some ways to start, including:
- encouraging links to your website
- engaging with your audience through good content
- promoting your site with social media

+ Search engines might see these links as a sign that you have a high-quality site,
and are perhaps a good option to show searchers.

+ backlinks – that means links to his site from other websites.

+ So how can you get more of these good links? The best way is to create great content on your own site.
Then, others may link to you because they think their audience should see your content.
You can also encourage others to write about you, and share links to your website.
In the SEO industry, this is called content marketing.

+ The best way to support off-site optimisation is by creating good content that
establishes your site as a quality resource, attracting visitors who then share it across social media.

3. Cross borders with SEO

+ Different countries require different marketing tactics, and
international search engine optimisation is no different.
In this lesson, you'll learn about changes to make when your website crosses international borders, including:
- language
- localization
- country targeting

+ The first is to make sure that each page in a different language has its own unique web page.
The second thing to keep in mind: mixing languages on the same page. This is a big mistake.
Next: Avoid using automated services to translate your content.
To help search engines discover this alternate content, in this case you’d be able to add an annotation
to each page.

+ But even if you don’t add multiple languages, there are other considerations for customers in different
countries and markets. Start by thinking about what information would be useful to them.
- Do you need to provide product prices in different currencies?
- Do they use a different system of measurement—metric versus imperial? For example, would customers weigh your avocados in kilos or pounds?
- Did you include local addresses and phone numbers so they can contact you?
- Do you need to list your business hours in different time zones?
- These are all small things you can do to make sure your website remains useful
to potential customers in different countries.

+ a country code top level domain name—ccTLD for short—it’s a strong indication
that your site targets a specific country.

MODULE 8/26: Be noticed with search ads

1. Introduction to search engine marketing (SEM)

+ Traditional advertising broadcasts a message to the world at large.
But search engine marketing targets a very specific group of people –
those actively looking for your products and services. In this video, you'll learn:
- what SEM is
- how it works
- why it works so well

+ search engine marketing, or SEM.

+ It’s simple, but effective: People search for things they want. And advertisers target specific searches,
but only pay if someone clicks to learn more. That’s search engine marketing.

2. The SEM auction
+ When advertisers compete to show ads on the same search results page,
search engines use an auction to determine which ads appear and in what order.
But there’s more to consider than just the price. In this video, we’ll talk through:
- how an SEM auction works
- factors that influence the outcome
- a detailed example.

+ Search engine marketing is based on an auction system. Search engines limit the number of slots adverts
can appear in on an individual page. Advertisers then compete in an auction for those slots.

+ So, success in the auction means having a competitive bid, as well as strong relevance.
Getting both of these right is the recipe for success in SEM.

+ The price you’re willing to pay for a click — the max CPC

+ The search engine probably considers your ad highly relevant.
That means you’d likely get a high Quality Score.
When two competing businesses have equal bid prices,
the business with a higher Quality Score will appear higher on the search results page.

3. What makes a good keyword

+ When you’re starting a new search engine marketing (SEM) campaign,
it’s important to understand what makes a keyword “good”.
In this video, you’ll learn which factors to consider before bidding on keywords, including:
- relevance
- traffic
- competition.

+ We’re also going to touch on three important factors to consider when choosing keywords.
These are relevance, traffic and competition.

+ But you should look for keywords where the relevance and traffic is high, and competition relatively low.

+ Measuring the value of your ad clicks will help you know if keywords are “good” or not.
But before you start a campaign, you won’t be able to measure the value your keywords are generating.
So how can you research keywords before adding them to your campaign? Well, you have a few different options here.
The first thing to ask yourself is: is this keyword relevant? Or in other words,
does this keyword closely describe your products or services?

+ Keyword research tools can provide traffic estimates to help you get a handle on this.

4. Make your ads stand out

+ Take a look at any search engine results page. It’s full of text!
How do you make your business’s adverts jump out in this jumble of words?
In this video, you’ll learn how to:
- attract more traffic with adverts that catch the searcher’s eye
- write headlines that make a connection
- write a clear, compelling call to action.

+ Let’s start with relevance. Relevance is the name of the game in search engine marketing.
Try and write your advert’s headline to match the searcher’s words as closely as possible.

+ The last thing you want is a strong, clear “call to action” in your advert.
In other words, tell visitors what you want them to do when they get to your site.
You could say “Browse Our Portfolio!” or “Buy!” or “Make a Reservation!”.
Research shows that people respond when you direct them to do something specific.
It’s a good idea to include this as the second line of your advert, so the searcher knows
exactly what to do after they click on your ad.

+ So what have we learned? Using a few simple guidelines can help your adverts stand out from the competition.
First, you want to customise your advert headline to the search.
Then include a special or timely offer.
And finally, give a compelling call to action.

MODULE 9/26: Improve your search campaigns

1. Achieve relevance with good structure
+ To succeed as an advertiser, you need to create adverts that help searchers find what they’re looking for –
and when you do, search engines may reward you. In this video, you’ll learn:
- how SEM campaigns are structured
- how to use that structure to achieve relevance
- the benefits you’ll get by focusing on relevance

+ Think of your SEM plan as an upside-down tree. At the top is your account,
which you create with Google Ads, Bing Ads, or another search engine.
Within the account are campaigns. Each campaign controls important decisions,
like the daily budget, the areas or countries where ads can appear, and the advertising networks you want to use.
Within each campaign, you can create multiple ad groups.
These are collections of keywords and the ads that go with them.

+ By dividing your products or services into separate campaigns and ad groups,
you can show ads that help customers find exactly what they’re searching for— which is win-win for everyone.

2. Get the most from your keywords
+ Search engines, like Google and Bing, offer tools that take the guesswork out of choosing the right keywords,
and can help potential customers find you online. We'll talk about:
- research tools
- related searches
- negative keywords


+  A tool like Google’s Keyword Planner or Bing’s Keyword Research Tool can help you find out which
keywords are most relevant and will work best for your new campaign.
For example, if you type in “pet portraits,” the tool will show you other related searches.

+ By organising these terms into ad groups, you can write relevant ads for each group of keywords.

+ you should use “negative keywords” to prevent your ads from appearing when people search for things
that aren’t relevant to your business.
These negative keywords will block your ads any time a search contains one or all of them.
This is useful, because preventing adverts from appearing for irrelevant searches,
is going to save you money, and make sure that only your ideal customer sees your ads.

3. Fine-tune with keyword match types

+ Search engine marketing (SEM) is great for letting you choose specific searches to trigger your ads.
But search engines often show your ads for keywords that are slightly different from the ones you’re targeting.
The solution: keyword match types. This video explains:
- what match types are and why they’re useful
- the different kinds of match types
- how to control which searches may trigger ads

+ search engines can show your ads when people search for variations of your keywords.
This is called broad matching.
Most of the time, broad match is useful. It means that you don’t have to add every variation of the keyword
you’d like to target, like singulars, plurals and misspellings.

+ But this flexibility also means that sometimes, search engines
show your ads for keywords that aren’t relevant to your business. Using keyword match types can help.

+ Keywords are broad match by default. Aside from broad match, the other primary match types are
phrase match and exact match.To change broad match to phrase, simply place quotations around the keyword.

+ Phrase match tells Google Ads or Bing Ads that adverts can’t be
displayed unless the search includes the entire phrase.
With phrase match, the searcher can include words before and after the phrase.

+ To get even more specific, exact match keywords are distinguished by
enclosing the word or phrase in square brackets. But minor variations, like plurals, can still trigger the ad.

+ As you change keywords from broad match, to phrase, to exact, it restricts the opportunities for ads to display.

4. How to know what’s working and what isn’t

+ One of the best ways to measure how well your search engine marketing is working
is by tracking conversions, or actions you’d like website visitors to take. In this video, we’ll cover:
- what conversions are
- how to choose the ones you want to measure
- what tools you can use to track them

+ One of the best things about SEM is that you can measure the value you’re getting from your campaigns.
To do this, you track conversions - the key actions you want website visitors to take—using tools
that search engines like Google or Bing provide.

+ way potential customers can become paying customers, so you should track that as a conversion as well.

+ you can use tools provided by search engines. These allow you, or whoever is managing your website for you,
to place a small piece of code on certain pages of your website.

+  In order to properly track conversions, you need to attach the code to pages someone
will only see after they’ve taken the action you want.
Once you install the code, you’ll start getting reports that tell you how many conversions you got.
That’s valuable information in figuring out if your online ad campaigns are working.

MODULE 10/26: Get noticed locally

1. Marketing to the locals
+ The Internet connects businesses and customers worldwide.
But if you’re a local business, you’ll want to reach people nearby. Let’s learn a bit about:
- what local means in digital
- how your business can build a local search presence
- and a perfect pair: local marketing and mobiles

+ First and foremost, be sure your location details are on your website.
If you have a shop, be sure to include your address, and maybe even an interactive map so a customer
can get directions, plus your telephone number, and your working hours.
And if you have a service area business, be sure your website explains what areas you serve,
and how people can get in touch with you.

+ Google My Business, Bing Local and Yahoo

2. The power of local directories
+ One of the best ways to connect with customers online is to get listed in local directories.
In this lesson we'll show you:
where to start
how to list your business
how to manage your local profiles.

+ The first step is to create a listing in local directories.
These online listings include your key information, like your business name, your address and your telephone number.

+ The name of your business seems straightforward
For the address, you’ll need a physical address or location. Post office boxes and shared locations usually won’t be accepted.
Just like with your business name, enter your address in the same exact way for every directory.
Telephone numbers should be local as well, including area and country code, so generally you won’t want to use a freephone number.
You’ve got to have these three things—name, address, telephone number—to land local customers.

+ First, you want your business and all those great local details to show up on the most popular search engines,
like Yahoo!, Bing and Google—and all of these have local versions and local business listings for you to use.

MODULE 11/26: Help people nearby find you online

1. Using digital to advertise locally

+ Local advertising is a great, affordable (sometimes even free) way to connect with customers
who are close at hand. In this lesson we’ll talk about:
- why local advertising is important
- where you can advertise online to local customers
- some special features of “local” ads

+ First, you have to remember that the Internet is everywhere. And that’s what makes local advertising different -
it’s limited to showing your ads to people who are local to you and likely to be - or become - your customers.

+ You can accomplish local advertising online through a lot of different channels, and search engines,
local directories, review sites, and social networks are great places to start.

+ all of the major search engines allow you to limit your ads showing to only people in certain locations
and geographies.

+ You might be able to list your hours of operation, or only show your ads when you’re open.
Or you might be able to let people get directions right to your storefront on a smartphone or mobile device,
let them ring your phone number with a single tap, or let them browse all your great reviews.

2. Reaching locals on their mobiles

+ Take advantage of the ways that mobile and local complement each other to connect with customers closest to you.
In this lesson we'll explore:
- the importance of being found in local search results
- making the most of mobile features, like GPS and applications (apps)
- using paid advertising to reach a local audience on the go

+ Think about your business. How do you marry mobile with local?
- To get started, make sure your customers can find you online, using any device,
and have a good experience whether they’re on a laptop, desktop, smartphone or tablet.
- Then, think about using mobile specific technology like GPS and apps to motivate customers
with local features and promotions
- And finally, if you’re advertising locally, you can target people nearby and on the go with your campaigns

3. SEO for local businesses
+ If you want to increase the chance of local customers finding your business, you need to know a bit about:
including key information on your website
how search engines choose local results
the importance of mobile

+ Remember: the role of a search engine is to provide the right result,
at the right time and in the right place for the searcher.
In order to do this, search engines may use the proximity of the searcher to your business,
or the geographic area they type in as part of their search.

+ many searchers are on the go, looking for local results on smartphones.
If your website can be found in the mobile search results it can be an important way to connect with customers,
so make sure that you’ve got a mobile friendly, quick loading website that search engines
can understand and visitors love.

+ Remember, following these steps can help search engines understand if your business is local:
Add location details to your website, Continually add quality content that’s relevant to your audience
and highlights the location of your business, Check your business listings on search engine and local
business directories, and Ensure your site is mobile-friendly and easy for both search engines and
visitors to understand.

MODULE 12/26: Get noticed with social media

1. Social media basics

+ Social media is everywhere, and people engage with it every day.
Learn what it is and how you can take advantage of these networks by:
- understanding why you need to be there
- joining the right social media sites
- growing your presence and engaging with your networks

+ Online networks, or “social media” as we call it, allow people to link,
interact, share and exchange information. They’ve quickly become something we can’t seem to live without.

+ When you join these social networks, you can join these conversations and start new ones.
Maybe you’ll start by sharing photos when you get new items in stock, and this will help you stay “top-of-mind”.
It also give people a reason to visit, again and again.
This way your network can grow quickly.
- Social media can also help you build trust with your audience.
- Social media provides an opportunity for your customers and fans to promote your products,
and when this happens, you earn trust.

+ And, there’s one last benefit of social media for your business:
You can learn by watching how people interact with your brand online.

+ First, you’ll want to get to know the different networks. Which ones are your customers using most?

2. The right social media sites for you

+ New social media sites pop up constantly. Here’s an overview of what’s out there and
how to figure out which ones might be important to you. We’ll go over:
- different types of networks
- understanding their contexts
- the best ways to get involved

+ When getting started with social media, it helps to sort all the different networks into
categories so that you can understand where you need to focus your attention.

+ There are lots of different sites out there dedicated to lots of different industries,
and you should search around to find the most important ones for your business.

+ And although membership on these sites might be smaller, those members can be exactly the kinds of
people you’re looking to attract.

+ On the other hand, if you’re a business that sells to other businesses,
this might be exactly where you want to advertise your products and services to other professionals
in very specific industries or job roles.

+ In the end, it’s all about understanding the objectives of each network, and
the people hanging out there that you want to connect with.

3. Setting your goals for social media

+ Once you’ve learned the lay of the land when it comes to social media,
it’s time to figure out what you’re trying to accomplish. Let’s talk about:
- setting specific goals for your social media efforts
- focusing your efforts on those goals
- putting your plan into action

+ Maybe you’re looking for a faster way to respond to customer inquiries.
Maybe social media’s a way for you to reach your existing customers and encourage them to buy from you more often.
Or maybe you’re looking to grow your business by finding new people who could become new customers.
These are all good examples of goals that social media can help you achieve, and there are plenty more.

+ Once you’ve got something to say, it’s time to figure out how you’ll find people to say it to.
- Remember, social media isn’t a one-way street. You also have to participate and give back to
your new network of friends and followers.
- The last thing you’ll need to plan is how you’re going to speak to the different audiences
in the different networks you’re using.

4. Getting on social media

+ Joining a social network usually starts with opening an account and creating a profile.
In this video we'll explore:
- the basics of getting started with a social media site
- the difference between business and individual accounts
- the importance of your profile.

+ First, social networks for businesses can be a little different than social networks for individuals.
Generally, it’s best to use your business email address to do this so you can keep your personal and
professional accounts separate.

+ Remember the tone of voice you decided to use and the business goals you want to support.
This will help you as you write the descriptions of your business, as you list your products,
choose the images or videos you want to showcase, and even personalise your profile page with background images.

+ Your profile page is often the place where you’ll be sharing your content,
having conversations, and displaying your activity.

+ Also, don’t forget many of these profile pages are also accessible by search engines,
so the more great content you provide here,
the better the chances that your social pages might even show up when people are searching on search engines!

+ Finally, many social networks offer advertising opportunities, or special features for a price.

+ Creating your business’s presence on the networks you’ll be using, always keeping your goals in mind,
is an essential step on the path to social success!
