FUNDAMENTALS OF DIGITAL MARKETING


MODULE 4/26: Plan your online business strategy

1. The benefits of an online strategy

+ The first step is to clearly define your goals.

+ Next up is articulating what your business stands for.
This can be represented by a simple sentence, generally referred to as a mission statement.
For example, this might be “to inspire healthier communities” or “to provide fun spaces for everyday fitness".

+ You also need to identify your Unique Selling Point (or USP) -
this is what makes you stand out from your competition online. 


2. Taking a business online

+ What are the key differences between a customer in a physical shop and a customer online?

-  In the offline world your journey might go a bit like this:
You visit the local shopping centre, going from shop to shop.
Ultimately, you make a decision based on price, quality, returns policy, friendliness of staff,
and stock availability.

- When it comes to online purchasing, you’re likely to engage in four distinct stages
throughout your online shopping journey.
Theses principles are described in the “See, Think, Do, Care”.

+ You can segment customers in many ways, from basic demographics like age and gender,
to specific interests.

+ When it comes to taking a business online, think about the customers
and put yourself in their shoes: which channels do they use most?
How do you engage differently with them online and offline?

3. Understanding customer behaviour

+ Customers are the key to success, which is why understanding and nurturing them is so important.
In this lesson we’ll look at the importance of customer touchpoints.

+ Touchpoints are used a lot in offline business, particularly in retail.
They can be receipts, bags, signage, customer service counters, and many other points along the way.
When a customer encounters a touchpoint multiple times, such as online ads,
this provides consistent value and creates ongoing positive associations with a brand.

+ To wrap up, here are some quick reminders to help you work on your own touchpoints:
- think about the journey you take as a customer when you buy something,
and apply this information to your business scenario.
- if you can, talk to customers to get real-world info on the touchpoints they encounter
- analyse touchpoint performance and optimise your message if required,
so that the customer’s needs always come first.

4. How to stand out from the competition

+ A Unique Selling Point is a clear statement that describes the benefits you offer,
how you might solve your customer’s needs, and what distinguishes you from the competition.
4 key questions to ask yourself when defining your USP are:
- who is my target audience?
- who are my competitors?
- what problems does my target audience have?, and
- how can I solve them?

+ Your USP should be displayed on your website, social media, and other marketing materials.
A good USP won't appeal to everyone, but that’s ok.
Build a USP that is tailored and speaks directly to your target audience.

+ SWOT analysis:
- what is it we’re good at? These are your strengths
- what can we do better? These are your weaknesses
- how can we grow, change and improve ? These are your opportunities
- what is happening or could happen, both internally and externally,
that might affect us negatively ? Those are the threats.

+ While constructing your USP, it’s a good idea to check what the competition is up to.
Search and see what the competition is up to. Use tool Google Alerts.

5. Using goals to improve business performance

+ Key Performance Indicators, or KPIs, are quantifiable measurements used to focus
attention on the metrics most important to meet business goals.
There are many ways to construct KPIs, but they should all be
measurable, practical, achievable, and provide direction.

+ Try creating your own KPIs and see if you can answer the following:
a. Is this KPI specific enough ?
b. Can it be measured ?
c. Can employees attain this ?
d. How relevant is it to the wider business objective ?
e. And lastly, when is it due to be delivered or carried out ?

MODULE 5/26 Get started with search

1. Search engine basics

+ One of the earliest search engines was a program called Archie, which debuted in 1990 and
allowed people to access and search file names—basically the names of the web pages.

2. How search engines work

+ The basics on how search engines find web pages, what they do with the pages they find,
and how they decide what results to show.

+ They all perform three tasks:
- First, they examine content they learn about andhave permission to see (that’s called crawling).
- Second, they categorise each piece of content (that’s called indexing).
- And third, they decide which content is most useful to searchers (that’s called ranking).

+ Search engines may find multiple copies of the exact same piece of content,
located on different websites. So you’re likely better off writing your own description.

3. How search engines see the web

+ In simple terms, when you ask a search engine to find something,
it looks through a huge list of previously indexed pages, called “the index,” and
pulls out relevant results based on what you’re looking for.

+ But when a search engine looks at the same page, in addition to seeing what you see on your screen,
it also sees the code behind it, called HTML.
- title tag
- name of image
- use tool CMS

4. Organic search explained

+ Organic results typically appear in the st match for the search query, or words, that were typed,
in centre of the page, and are the results the search engine decides are the be.

+ Making improvements to your website to help it appear in the organic results is
called search engine optimisation, or SEO.
Good SEO involves helping a search engine find and understand your site.

+ What do search engines like? Good, relevant content.
All you have to do is make sure that your content is relevant to the people searching,
so they’ll click and stay for a visit.

5. Paid search explained

+ We’ll cover how advertising on search engines works—that’s called SEM, or search engine marketing.

+ Every time someone searches advertisers compete for the opportunity to display ads.
It happens in milliseconds and the searcher won’t see the details, only the winners: the ads that appear on the page.
So, how do search engines decide who wins? The primary components are the bid and the quality.

6. Google search console

+ Google Search Console? Well, it's a service that gives you feedback about how your website is doing
in Google search results. It has two primary functions. It monitors your performance in Google Search results.
And it also shows you how Google “sees” your site.

+ One way is through its “Search Analytics” reports.
This can help you answer a few important questions like which searches bring people to your site.
Or tell you when searchers click on your links. They can even let you know which other sites link to yours.

+ Another thing to look for is the number of clicks.
You’ll want to know how often your site appears but gets no clicks—
that’s a sign your content doesn’t match what people are looking for.

+ The “Links to your site” report shows websites that link to your site. Think of these as “referrals.”

+ Mobile Usability Report

+ There are two more really handy features within Search Console to know about:
“Crawl” reports, and “Google Index” reports.
- “Crawl” reports let you monitor whether Google can visit your web pages.
This is important because if Google can’t access your web pages,
your content can’t be included in Google’s search results.

- The “Google Index” reports show what information Google recorded about your site and
tells you if your pages are accessible. It’s easy to get started with Search Console.

Go to www.google.com/webmasters.
Once signed in, add your website and complete the verification to prove you own the website.

MODULE 6/26: Get discovered with search

1. Intro to search engine optimisation (SEO)

+ when search engines understand your content, it will be shown to many more potential customers.

+ Search engines have formulas, or algorithms, that help them order the list of results.
The search engines constantly scour the web for new content and try to make sense of it.

+ Where your website appears in these results is affected by the words
you use on your site (fresh farm produce, for example) as well as other factors—such as
how many websites link to yours.

+ What search engines value most is unique, engaging, relevant content
because their job is to find and show the most useful stuff.

2. The importance of an SEO plan

+ In this step-by-step process to create an SEO plan for your website, you'll learn how to:
- develop
- prioritise
- adjust the plan to best suit your goals

+ Your first step should be keyword research. Next, consider related topics.
You should do this at least once a year as part of your SEO plan.

+ Is no one linking to your site? Perhaps you can invite food bloggers to check out
your farm in the hopes that they’ll mention you in a future blog post.
Make a list of anything you think might improve your SEO performance.

+ Give yourself a deadline for each task so you’re working through your SEO plan steadily throughout the year.
OK, once you’ve set this plan in motion, don’t just forget about it.

+ Review your results regularly and shift focus to the areas that need help.

+ Let’s recap. Start with keyword research to understand what your customers are looking for,
then use that info to assess your successes and failures.
Brainstorm solutions to improve your weak spots, and prioritise them.
And never be afraid to redo your SEO plan based on changes in your world and the world of search engines.

3. The SEO process

+ This video explains the SEO process and the steps you need to take in order to optimise your website, including:
- discovering what words or phrases people use to search for your products or services
- improving the content on your site.

+ The first step is called keyword research: discovering what words or phrases people are looking for
when they are searching for products and services related to your business.

+ The work of SEO is never done, because trends come and go, users can change their behavior,
and search engines evolve over time. Your job is to consider how changes will impact your site and
what you need to do to continue to attract unpaid (organic) traffic.
Here are 4 quick tips on how to stay up-to-date on search.
- 1: Learn how search engines work.
- 2: Keep an eye on changes and monitor how they affect your website.
- 3: Find inspiration from other websites.
- 4: Talk to your customers.

4. How to choose keywords

+ Choosing keywords is the cornerstone of successful search engine optimisation. In this video, we'll discuss:
- why you need to do keyword research
- the difference between short tail and long tail keywords
- what to consider when selecting keywords

+ There are three things you should consider when choosing the keywords for your SEO plan.
- First, frequency, or the number of times a word is searched for.
- Our second consideration: Competition. If you have a large, established website,
you may be able to appear on the search engine results for high-volume, highly competitive keywords
- Finally, and most importantly, the third consideration is relevance.
The keywords you select should closely match what you actually offer.

+ Make sure your chosen keywords match the intent of the people who are searching.
How? One option is to use Google Search Console to see which pages appear in search and get clicks.

+ What you need to consider when selecting keywords: frequency, competition and relevance.

5. Setting realistic SEO goals

+ Setting realistic goals for organic traffic and assessing them with measurements
that matter will help you strengthen your SEO strategy. In this video, you'll learn:
- how to define success
- how to select measurements that matter
- what tools can help

+ One way to tackle SEO is to set clear goals, then measure your progress each step of the way.
When you set SEO goals, you can measure, track and report on the results.
You’ll know which efforts are succeeding—and which aren’t. And then you can adjust things to make it work better.

+ You’ve just identified three business goals:
- Conversions: Turning website visitors into paying customers.
- Engagement: Persuading people to interact with the content on your site.
- Acquisition: Getting new customers.

+ The lesson? Don’t waste effort on keywords that aren’t relevant to what you do.

+ You can measure conversions by tracking the number of visitors who come to your website and buy fruits and
vegetables; or tracking a smaller action that can lead to a sale, like signing up for your email newsletter.
+ You can measure acquisition and reach by tracking the number of times your business appears in
search results—your “impressions”—and how often people click through to visit your site.
+ And, you can measure engagement by tracking what content your visitors read and interact with,
such as leaving comments, or how many visitors become your fans on social media networks.
+ So how do you track all these things? Analytics tools and webmaster tools provided by search engines
can give you this information—often for free.


MODULE 7/26: Make search work for you

1. Making your web pages search friendly

+ Get started in search engine optimisation by improving the pages on your website.
This video explains the elements that you can tweak to make your website easier for search engines to understand.
We'll cover:
- title and description meta tags
- heading elements
- page copy

+ The title and meta description are important because they both are used by the search engine
to generate the actual search result for the specific page.
The title is used to generate the first line shown; the meta description is used to
generate the few short sentences that follow. A good meta description is usually two short sentences.
A title should be short and sweet; a description should match what the page is about.

+ What you’ve done to optimise the farm’s web pages. You’ve looked at each of the major elements used by
search engines and, in each instance, told them, “This page is about fresh fruits and vegetables.”

2. How other websites can work for you

+ You can improve your search visibility across the web by thinking about off-site optimisation; that is,
using what happens on other websites to promote yours. This video will show you some ways to start, including:
- encouraging links to your website
- engaging with your audience through good content
- promoting your site with social media

+ Search engines might see these links as a sign that you have a high-quality site,
and are perhaps a good option to show searchers.

+ backlinks – that means links to his site from other websites.

+ So how can you get more of these good links? The best way is to create great content on your own site.
Then, others may link to you because they think their audience should see your content.
You can also encourage others to write about you, and share links to your website.
In the SEO industry, this is called content marketing.

+ The best way to support off-site optimisation is by creating good content that
establishes your site as a quality resource, attracting visitors who then share it across social media.

3. Cross borders with SEO

+ Different countries require different marketing tactics, and
international search engine optimisation is no different.
In this lesson, you'll learn about changes to make when your website crosses international borders, including:
- language
- localization
- country targeting

+ The first is to make sure that each page in a different language has its own unique web page.
The second thing to keep in mind: mixing languages on the same page. This is a big mistake.
Next: Avoid using automated services to translate your content.
To help search engines discover this alternate content, in this case you’d be able to add an annotation
to each page.

+ But even if you don’t add multiple languages, there are other considerations for customers in different
countries and markets. Start by thinking about what information would be useful to them.
- Do you need to provide product prices in different currencies?
- Do they use a different system of measurement—metric versus imperial? For example, would customers weigh your avocados in kilos or pounds?
- Did you include local addresses and phone numbers so they can contact you?
- Do you need to list your business hours in different time zones?
- These are all small things you can do to make sure your website remains useful
to potential customers in different countries.

+ a country code top level domain name—ccTLD for short—it’s a strong indication
that your site targets a specific country.

MODULE 8/26: Be noticed with search ads

1. Introduction to search engine marketing (SEM)

+ Traditional advertising broadcasts a message to the world at large.
But search engine marketing targets a very specific group of people –
those actively looking for your products and services. In this video, you'll learn:
- what SEM is
- how it works
- why it works so well

+ search engine marketing, or SEM.

+ It’s simple, but effective: People search for things they want. And advertisers target specific searches,
but only pay if someone clicks to learn more. That’s search engine marketing.

2. The SEM auction
+ When advertisers compete to show ads on the same search results page,
search engines use an auction to determine which ads appear and in what order.
But there’s more to consider than just the price. In this video, we’ll talk through:
- how an SEM auction works
- factors that influence the outcome
- a detailed example.

+ Search engine marketing is based on an auction system. Search engines limit the number of slots adverts
can appear in on an individual page. Advertisers then compete in an auction for those slots.

+ So, success in the auction means having a competitive bid, as well as strong relevance.
Getting both of these right is the recipe for success in SEM.

+ The price you’re willing to pay for a click — the max CPC

+ The search engine probably considers your ad highly relevant.
That means you’d likely get a high Quality Score.
When two competing businesses have equal bid prices,
the business with a higher Quality Score will appear higher on the search results page.

3. What makes a good keyword

+ When you’re starting a new search engine marketing (SEM) campaign,
it’s important to understand what makes a keyword “good”.
In this video, you’ll learn which factors to consider before bidding on keywords, including:
- relevance
- traffic
- competition.

+ We’re also going to touch on three important factors to consider when choosing keywords.
These are relevance, traffic and competition.

+ But you should look for keywords where the relevance and traffic is high, and competition relatively low.

+ Measuring the value of your ad clicks will help you know if keywords are “good” or not.
But before you start a campaign, you won’t be able to measure the value your keywords are generating.
So how can you research keywords before adding them to your campaign? Well, you have a few different options here.
The first thing to ask yourself is: is this keyword relevant? Or in other words,
does this keyword closely describe your products or services?

+ Keyword research tools can provide traffic estimates to help you get a handle on this.

4. Make your ads stand out

+ Take a look at any search engine results page. It’s full of text!
How do you make your business’s adverts jump out in this jumble of words?
In this video, you’ll learn how to:
- attract more traffic with adverts that catch the searcher’s eye
- write headlines that make a connection
- write a clear, compelling call to action.

+ Let’s start with relevance. Relevance is the name of the game in search engine marketing.
Try and write your advert’s headline to match the searcher’s words as closely as possible.

+ The last thing you want is a strong, clear “call to action” in your advert.
In other words, tell visitors what you want them to do when they get to your site.
You could say “Browse Our Portfolio!” or “Buy!” or “Make a Reservation!”.
Research shows that people respond when you direct them to do something specific.
It’s a good idea to include this as the second line of your advert, so the searcher knows
exactly what to do after they click on your ad.

+ So what have we learned? Using a few simple guidelines can help your adverts stand out from the competition.
First, you want to customise your advert headline to the search.
Then include a special or timely offer.
And finally, give a compelling call to action.
